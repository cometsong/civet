CIVET Release Notes
This document describes the high-level changes made to the civet software
from release to release.  It is cumulative, with the most recent changes
listed first.  The most up-to-date version is in the civet git repository
redmine:/var/git/civet.git

Version 1.3.0
-------------
Bug fixes
 - Don't insert a space between an option's command_text and value if 
   command_text ends it either '=' or ':' when generating command line
 - Fix civet_status display of pipelines submitted with --no-submit

Features
 - Implemented "option override"
 - Implemented threads="True" tool options (value is taken from Tool's
   threads attribute)

Version 1.2.1
-------------
Bug fixes
 - Civet did not correctly detect command failures indicated by a non-
   zero return status.

This is a bug-fix-only release, and contains no new features.

Version 1.2.0
-------------
Bug fixes
 - Fix incorrect Torque error code -> error string mappings. Had to implement 
   our own lookup, since pbs_python had old (Torque 2.X) mappings

Features
 - Enhanced exception handling for job submission errors (users no longer
   see a stack trace when there is a Torque error, instead they simply 
   see a helpful error message) 
 - Modify parse_XML to allow an optional colon separated list of directories
   to search for XML tool definition files. The civet_run command now will 
   pass the contents of the CIVET_PATH environment variable as this parameter.
 - Add new syntax for explicitly declaring the default output directory,
   <dir ... default_output="True" ... />  If not specified, the current
   working directory is used.
   Previously the default output directory was implicitly specified as the
   first directory tag in the XML that wasn't marked as input="True". This
   promised to be error prone and complicate future maintenance.
 - Add a new file to the logs directory named command_line.txt, which
   contains the current working directory when the civet pipeline was
   invoked, and the entire invoking pipeline command line.
 - The version string management was proving to be error prone when
   cutting new versions.  Updated the version reporting to leverage
   git capabilities.  Version is now obtained from git, rather than
   being hardcoded.

Version 1.1.0
-------------
Bug fixes
 - Fix problem creating directories when create="False" was specified.
   Sometimes this attribute was ignored. Reported by Anu.
   
Features
 - Enhanced civet_status:
    - default is now an abbreviated status listing
    - the --verbose option now outputs the original job-by-job status
    - the --recursive (short form -r) option searches the specified tree for 
      log directories and outputs status for each one found
 - Mail is now set to the submitting user at the end of each run.
 - In the event of a cancelled or aborted pipeline run, the user only receives
   one email, not one per cancelled / aborted cluster job.

Features added that are not used by cga pipelines:
  - For pipeline implementers: add civet_run option --no-submit (short form -n)
    ability to generate scripts but not actually submit them to the cluster

Version 1.0.0
-------------
Initial production release
