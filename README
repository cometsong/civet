Civet is a framework for developing command line analysis pipelines that
execute through a batch system common on High Performance Computing (HPC)
systems.  Currently only the TORQUE resource manager is supported, but others
may be supported in the future.

A Civet pipeline is defined by an XML file that describes the files operated on
by the pipeline (the files can be input from the user, produced by a step in
the pipeline, or may be hard coded reference files) and the steps that act on
the files. Each tool that may be invoked by the pipeline is defined by its own
XML file. These tool definitions may be shared between pipelines, allowing
multiple pipelines to make use of a common set of tools.

Civet operates entirely in the user space, and can be installed without
administrator permissions. It leverages the batch system's job dependency
features to control pipeline execution. Pipeline flow is fixed at submission
time; conditional branching is not supported.

See the documentation in the docs subdirectory for more information about the
framework.
