			will be materialized as the full file path.  We include
			the ID outdir because the QC tool we're invoking will create
			various analysis statistics files and drop them in a
			directory (specified by the ID outdir).  Since they aren't
			used as input in a later stage, the statistics files don't
			need IDs of their own.
			
			The actual invocation of the QC tool is described in
			glen_qc_tool.xml, not in this file.

		Steps are invoked in lexical order.  So the Alignment process
		will run after the QC process completes.
		
		There is an opportunity here for optimization by file dependency
		tracking.  We could conceivably run a process as soon as its input
		files are ready.  Probably will NOT DO this in the first release.
