This is an alternate maim program for the pipeline code, that 
collects all the files that need to be validated, and 
generates a json file with their data.  The created file
must be moved into the proper directory for the pipeline's use
(the same directory as the pipeline's main xml file).

Invoke the command with the path to the pipeline's top level 
xml file.  The same cluster software modules as will be 
eventually loaded by the pipeline must be loaded prior to 
execution, and it must be run on one of the cluster's execution
nodes, i.e., it must be run as part of a qsub'd job.
